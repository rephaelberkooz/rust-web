# Rust Web

A repository for my explorations for using Rust in web development.

## Usage

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed.

Build the relevant Rust binaries:

```bash
cargo build
```

Run the server:

```bash
cargo run
```

Navigate to `localhost:8080/index.html`

## Notes

The `static` folder contains WASM binaries built from another
repo - these are not built here (maybe git submodule soon?).
